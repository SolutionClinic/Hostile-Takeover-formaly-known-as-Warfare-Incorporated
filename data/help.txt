<A NAME="background"><H1>STORY BACKGROUND</H1></A>
<H2>The year is 2065 and mega corporations rule the galaxy. Two of the largest companies, ACME Exploration and OMNI Industries, are vying for dominance in the mining of an extremely rare and incredibly valuable mineral called Galaxite. Galaxite can be used to 'rip' particles from one location to another almost instantly and over any distance. This is accomplished by creating matching quirk fields which, when synchronized, create a momentary Einstein-Rosen wormhole bridge between the two locations. OMNI Industries is the largest corporation in existence with a Gross National Product (GNP) that exceeds that of all but the richest countries. OMNI has a stranglehold on a variety of different markets ranging from diamonds to Galaxite mining. ACME Exploration is the second largest corporation in existence and is urgently trying to secure the number 1 spot.<BR>
Six weeks ago an ACME owned, unmanned probe en route to the star Tau Ceti reported back that an unexplored planet, Icarus, contained 'massive' Galaxite deposits. ACME has dispatched a colony ship to the location. On board are Gordon Fox, Mining Base Commander, Jana Perez, a Senior Research Scientist, her fiance, Andy Whitmore, a Mining Operations Trainee, and Arthur Olstrom, a Sr. Mining Executive; it includes the equipment and people necessary to exploit and defend their claim. If ACME can successfully claim Icarus it may well become the richest and most powerful mega corporation of them all!</H2>

<A NAME="gettingstarted"><H1>GETTING STARTED </H1></A>
<H2>To begin a new game, or continue after completing the sampler mission and registering, refer to <A HREF="#playstory">Begin New Game</A>.  Once you begin, if you switch away to another program using a device button, turn off your device, or you select "Exit Game" from the In Game <A HREF="#menu">Menu</A>, your current place in the game will be preserved. If a mission ends in failure you will have an option to retry that mission. If you wish to preserve incremental progress within a mission, you can <A HREF="#savegame">save</A> the game at any time. Choosing Abort at the end of a mission will abort your game.</H2>
<HR>
<A NAME="playstory"><H1>BEGIN NEW GAME </H1></A>
<H2>This launches you into Mission 1, a training mission which is an excellent place to start. You'll learn how to create buildings, build units and move your forces around. However, there are some features that are not covered in the training mission and are helpful to know ahead of time. Refer to <A HREF="#advanced">Advanced Features</A> for more information. As you finish each mission you will be taken to the next mission in the adventures of Andy, Jana, Olstrom and Fox. Watch your rank increase with each successfully completed mission.</H2>

<H2>To maximize replayability, you can re-play individual story missions. From the Main Menu select "Play Mission". Then from the Play Mission Menu select "Play Story Mission". You can select any of the fourteen story missions. Note: if you launch the story missions in this way rather than playing through the game from the beginning, you will not be able to attain the top rank possible in the game. To start as a trainee and complete as a CEO you should use the <A HREF="#playstory">Begin New Game</A> option on the Main Menu.</H2>
<HR>
<A NAME="changeoptions"><H1>CHANGING THE GAME OPTIONS </H1></A>
<H2>If you would like to adjust the audio, display, or game settings tap on the <A HREF="#gameoptions">Options</A> button in the Main Menu.  Options are also accessible from the In Game <A HREF="#menu">Menu</A>.

<A NAME="OptionsGame"><H1>GAME</H1></A>
<H2>You can adjust the game speed by adjusting the slider to the right for faster game play and to the left for a slower game play. Once the game is playing as fast as the device allows, increasing the game speed will not have an effect.<BR>
You can check the Lasso Selection box to change the way you select multiple units, from tapping and dragging a square containing the units you would like to select, to freehand drawing a loop around the units you would like to select.<BR>
There are three difficulty settings for the game. This setting can be changed at any time and will take effect immediately. <BR>
Tapping the Default button will restore all three settings: game speed, lasso selection and difficulty, to their default values.</H2>

<HR>
<A NAME="OptionsColor"><H1>COLOR</H1></A>
<H2>On some devices the game will benefit from adjustments to the Hue, Saturation and Brightness. We have included default settings for several devices. Select this option from the In Game <A HREF="#menu">Menu</A> to see the Hostile Takeover background and units as you make adjustments. There are two different types of terrain: grass and desert. Experimentation may be required.<BR>
Selecting the Default button will return all three values to their default setting.</H2>
<HR>
<A NAME="OptionsDisplay"><H1>DISPLAY</H1></A>

If your device is capable of more than one display configuration you will have multiple choices here. These will be formatted as follows: horizontal-pixels x vertical-pixels, color if your device can do color, high or low resolution as suits your device and then degrees of rotation from the default display orientation if your device supports it.

The dollar symbol will flash if you are too low on credits to complete a task. Note that the building constructing units when you run out of credits will also flash a dollar sign. If you have no Bullpups you can sell a building to get more credits to continue unit production. Sell a Galaxite Warehouse only as a last resort, you will lose its contents when you sell.</H2>
<BR>
<H2>To the right of the Credit Indicator is your Power Indicator. It shows your current power supply in bars and your current demand with small triangles above and below the bars. The power symbol will flash when your power is too low. On color devices the bars will be green when you have plenty of power, yellow when you have just enough power and red when your power is too low.</H2>
