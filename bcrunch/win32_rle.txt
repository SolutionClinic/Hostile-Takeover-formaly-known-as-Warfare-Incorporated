Windows 8bit RLE
+++

When the biCompression member of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure is set to
BI_RLE8, the DIB is compressed using a run-length encoded format for a
256-color bitmap. This format uses two modes: encoded mode and absolute mode.
Both modes can occur anywhere throughout a single bitmap.

Encoded Mode

A unit of information in encoded mode consists of two bytes. The first byte
specifies the number of consecutive pixels to be drawn using the color index
contained in the second byte.  The first byte of the pair can be set to zero
to indicate an escape that denotes the end of a line, the end of the bitmap,
or a delta. The interpretation of the escape depends on the value of the
second byte of the pair, which must be in the range 0x00 through 0x02.
Following are the meanings of the escape values that can be used in the
second byte:

Second byte	Meaning

0	End of line. 
1	End of bitmap. 
2	Delta. The two bytes following the escape contain unsigned values
indicating the horizontal and vertical offsets of the next pixel from the
current position.

Absolute Mode

Absolute mode is signaled by the first byte in the pair being set to zero and
the second byte to a value between 0x03 and 0xFF. The second byte represents
the number of bytes that follow, each of which contains the color index of a
single pixel. Each run must be aligned on a word boundary.  Following is an
example of an 8-bit RLE bitmap (the two-digit hexadecimal values in the
second column represent a color index for a single pixel):

Compressed data		Expanded data

03 04			04 04 04 
05 06			06 06 06 06 06 
00 03 45 56 67 00	45 56 67 
02 78			78 78 
00 02 05 01		Move 5 right and 1 down 
02 78			78 78 
00 00			End of line 
09 1E			1E 1E 1E 1E 1E 1E 1E 1E 1E 
00 01			End of RLE bitmap 

Compression of 4-Bits-per-Pixel Bitmaps

When the biCompression member of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure is set to
BI_RLE4, the DIB is compressed using a run-length encoded format for a
16-color bitmap. This format uses two modes: encoded mode and absolute mode.

Encoded Mode

A unit of information in encoded mode consists of two bytes. The first byte
of the pair contains the number of pixels to be drawn using the color indexes
in the second byte.

The second byte contains two color indexes, one in its high-order nibble
(that is, its low-order 4 bits) and one in its low-order nibble.

The first pixel is drawn using the color specified by the high-order nibble,
the second is drawn using the color in the low-order nibble, the third is
drawn with the color in the high-order nibble, and so on, until all the
pixels specified by the first byte have been drawn.

The first byte of the pair can be set to zero to indicate an escape that
denotes the end of a line, the end of the bitmap, or a delta. The
interpretation of the escape depends on the value of the second byte of the
pair. In encoded mode, the second byte has a value in the range 0x00 through
0x02. The meaning of these values is the same as for a DIB with 8 bits per
pixel.

Absolute Mode

In absolute mode, the first byte contains zero, the second byte contains the
number of color indexes that follow, and subsequent bytes contain color
indexes in their high- and low-order nibbles, one color index for each pixel.
Each run must be aligned on a word boundary.

Following is an example of a 4-bit RLE bitmap (the one-digit hexadecimal
values in the second column represent a color index for a single pixel):

Compressed data		Expanded data

03 04			0 4 0 
05 06			0 6 0 6 0 
00 06 45 56 67 00	4 5 5 6 6 7 
04 78			7 8 7 8 
00 02 05 01		Move 5 right and 1 down 
04 78			7 8 7 8 
00 00			End of line 
09 1E			1 E 1 E 1 E 1 E 1 
00 01			End of RLE bitmap
