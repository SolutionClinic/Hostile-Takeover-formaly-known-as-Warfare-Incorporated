<h4>Hostile Takeover Author Kit Overview</h4>
<p>The Hostile Takeover Author Kit contains the tools needed to create content 
like new levels and graphics for Hostile Takeover.</p>
<p class="labelproc">Game Databases</p>
<p>Hostile Takeover makes use of &quot;Game Database&quot; (.pdb) files to store its 
content. There is a custom game database for each major graphics format Hostile 
Takeover supports. For example htdata816.pdb contains graphics tuned for 8-bit, 
lores (16-pixel tile) devices whereas htdata424.pdb contains graphics tuned for 
4-bit hires (24-pixel tile) devices. There is a separate database (htsfx.pdb) 
which stores sound effects. The tool <a href="packpdb2Ref.htm">packpdb2.exe</a> 
is able to create Game Databases and extract or view their contents.</p>
<p class="labelproc">Levels</p>
<p>Single and multiplayer levels are created with the <a href="MapEditorRef.htm">
Map Editor</a> (M.exe) then <a href="HowToAddALevelToAGameDatabase.htm">added to 
a Game Database</a> with the utility <a href="mkpdbRef.htm">mkpdb.bat</a>. Level 
files, also known as Level Description files, have the extension .ld. See
<a href="HowToCreateALevel.htm">how to create a Level</a> for details.</p>
<p class="labelproc">Templates, Template Collections</p>
<p>Maps are created in the Map Editor by assembling puzzle piece-like Templates 
which have been designed to fit together to form roads, cliff ranges, rivers, 
etc. The <a href="TemplateExtractorRef.htm">TemplateExtractor</a> utility is 
used to extract Template art, terrain information and name from artist-friendly 
source files and convert them into Map Editor and game-friendly Template 
Collection (.tc) files.</p>
<p>A single Template Collection contains all the Templates for maps of a region, 
e.g., grassy or sandy. Template art is authored as 24-bit color images that 
break down into 24x24 tiles. Automated tools perform the job of reducing the 
Template art to Hostile Takeover-compatible 8-bit color art including scaling 
down the art to accommodate lores devices. A Template Terrain info image is 
scanned to determine which areas of the templates block the movement and 
placement of units/structures in the game. For details on all of this see
<a href="HowToCreateATemplateCollection.htm">how to create a Template Collection</a>.</p>
<p class="labelproc">Testing new Levels and Templates</p>
<p>Once a Template Collection has been assembled and a Level(s) created add them 
to a Game Database (see <a href="HowToAddATemplateCollectionToAGameDatabase.htm">
adding Template Collections to a Game Database</a> and
<a href="HowToAddALevelToAGameDatabase.htm">adding Levels to a Game Database</a>) 
and launch <a href="HostileTakeoverRef.htm">Hostile Takeover</a> to give them a 
play test.</p>
<p class="labelproc">Helper utilities</p>
<p>Several shortcut utilities have been included in this kit to reduce the 
number of steps needed for common authoring operations. They are:</p>
<table border="0" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 10pt" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%" id="AutoNumber1" bgcolor="#DEEAEF" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="21%"><b>makeall.bat</b></td>
    <td width="79%">Extracts grassy Templates to create grassy.tc, then adds it 
    and the grassy_test.ld Level to the htdata816.pdb and htdata824.pdb Game 
    Databases </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="21%"><b>updGrassy16.bat&nbsp;&nbsp; </b></td>
    <td width="79%">Adds grassy.tc and grassy_test.ld to htdata816.pdb</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="21%"><b>updGrassy24.bat</b></td>
    <td width="79%">Adds grassy.tc and grassy_test.ld to htdata824.pdb</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Use these batch files as a starting point to create your own helpers. It may 
be as simple as searching for each &quot;grassy&quot; and replacing with the name of your 
environment, e.g., &quot;sandy&quot;.</p>
