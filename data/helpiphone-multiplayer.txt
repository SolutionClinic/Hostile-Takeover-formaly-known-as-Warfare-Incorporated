<A NAME="background"><H1>STORY BACKGROUND</H1></A>
<H2>The year is 2065 and mega corporations rule the galaxy. Two of the largest companies, ACME Exploration and OMNI Industries, are vying for dominance in the mining of an extremely rare and incredibly valuable mineral called Galaxite. Galaxite can be used to 'rip' particles from one location to another almost instantly and over any distance. This is accomplished by creating matching quirk fields which, when synchronized, create a momentary Einstein-Rosen wormhole bridge between the two locations. OMNI Industries is the largest corporation in existence with a Gross National Product (GNP) that exceeds that of all but the richest countries. OMNI has a stranglehold on a variety of different markets ranging from diamonds to Galaxite mining. ACME Exploration is the second largest corporation in existence and is urgently trying to secure the number 1 spot.<BR>
Six weeks ago an ACME owned, unmanned probe en route to the star Tau Ceti reported back that an unexplored planet, Icarus, contained 'massive' Galaxite deposits. ACME has dispatched a colony ship to the location. On board are Gordon Fox, Mining Base Commander, Jana Perez, a Senior Research Scientist, her fiance, Andy Whitmore, a Mining Operations Trainee, and Arthur Olstrom, a Sr. Mining Executive; it includes the equipment and people necessary to exploit and defend their claim. If ACME can successfully claim Icarus it may well become the richest and most powerful mega corporation of them all!</H2>

Winners are awarded a rating increase relative to the likelihood of a win. For example if a player plays an opponent with a higher rating, the rating increase will be higher than if the opponent had a lower rating. There are also special provisions for team games. Players in the winning team are similarly awarded based on the likelihood of the win. However an individual player's share of the win is proportional to the number of enemies that player killed, out of all enemies killed by the team. To have a rating, a player must <A HREF="#login">login</A> with a player name. Logged in players start at a rating of 1500. Computer players have a rating of 1200.

<H2>Investing in a R&D Center will allow you to upgrade your <A HREF="#hrc">HRC</A> and <A HREF="#vts">VTS</A>, giving you access to the newest technologies available.

However, even after upgrading the HRC, if you lose your R&D Center you will be unable to create <A HREF="#corporateraider">Corporate Raiders</A>. The R&D center must be intact for these very special units to be available. <BR>

<H2>These guard towers are equipped with machine guns and are fairly effective at keeping the competition out. A fully powered <A HREF="#radar">Surveillance Center</A> is required for the targeting systems to function so that towers will fire automatically as enemies come into range. You can also direct their fire by tapping on the tower and then tapping on the enemy you wish to fire upon. Note that these towers take a great deal of power to remain operational. As you create towers, be sure to keep an eye on your power meter. A flashing lightening bolt symbol on your tower indicates that it is under powered and will not fire at the enemy.<BR>

<A NAME="upgrades"><H1>Research Upgrades </H1></A>
<BR>
<H2>Research upgrades allow you to improve the units available at your Human Resource Center (HRC) and Vehicle Transport Station (VTS). The Research & Development Center is available starting on Mission 3. Select this building and use the build icon to view available upgrades. Upgrading the HRC enables production of Rocket Troopers and later Corporate Raiders. Upgrading the VTS enables production of Dominions, Cyclops and other advanced tanks. Not all upgrades are available in all missions. It is worth noting that even after you have upgraded your HRC, the R&D Center must survive to enable production of <A HREF="#corporateraider">Corporate Raiders</A>. Therefore you cannot sell this building if you wish to produce these very special units.<BR>

<H2>Players can create new Add-On Mission Packs using the mission authoring toolkit. Using this tool, you can design, test, and share the missions you have authored with the player community. To begin, visit the Mission Authoring section of the Hostile Takeover forums and read everything there. Once you have a mission pack that you want to test, you'll want to get it on to your device. To do this, upload your mission to any location on the internet. Start the game, tap on Add-On Mission Packs. Tap on the Title label to sort by name, and you'll see "Custom URL..." near the top. Tap on this and select DOWNLOAD, and enter the custom URL to your mission pack and tap OK, and it will be downloaded to your device. Now you can play and refine your mission pack until it is ready to share with the community. To share it, visit the Mission Sharing section of the website for instructions on how to post it there. Posting it there will add it to the Add-On Mission Pack list that all players see.</H2>
