- normalize bitmaps
- MRU file list

* version .24
* About dialog w/ version #
* expanded Strips and Bitmaps selections to cover whole row
* drag/drop .amx from Explorer [must be dropped in Strips window]
* Save .amx now always builds a bitmap subdir and writes all bitmaps to it
  [NOTE: subdir contents are not deleted so it is possible for unused bitmaps
  to accumulate. I've left it this way so we can add the bitmap dirs to CVS
  and for other minor coveniences. To clean out cruft, save as .zip. Only
  referenced bitmaps will be included in the .zip]
* load/save packaged animations (.zips)

- drag into but don't drop on Frames StripControl leaves insertion point,
  scroll timer state broken
- no way to delete individual bitmaps in a frame
- reimporting altered-sized bitmaps almost certainly hoses the positioning of
  the bitmap in existing frames
- need keyboard shortcut for moving forward and backward through strips

* WriteAnir multiple bitmaps/frame [limited to 2 for now]
