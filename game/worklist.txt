* need "Connecting..." from Specify panel. And "not found" if not found! Plus timeout (from 4155) is too long
- wifi game name not shown when hosting?
- finish M_16 fixes
- get someone to test Wc13Transport.dll
- WI exited looking for devices. Bad name? Name too long? Stack problem?
- if host crashes or otherwise doesn't ever respond while client is "Waiting for all players..." the client hangs forever
- pause bringing up join screen
- add (space) to input form

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bugs
- Bullpups ignoring fog. Related?: players feel that Bullpup Gx search is broken
- some clients see black screen while others see "Waiting for all players"
- handle device/network turning off while system network UI forms are up
- Treo 600 sometimes crashes immediately upon pressing "multiplayer"
- crash after OK on TooManyTCPConnections (ux50)

UI
- need some sort of client timeout between connecting and receiving first game info in case the game info never arrives
- remember specified addresses?
- multiplayer-appropriate summary screens (win/lose/objectives)
- show real game duration at summary

Misc
- updates to WI startup screen (hi/med/lo)
  - copyright year
- alliances
- Handmark MP launch
- rendezvous/packet forwarding server
? buffer AsyncSends to send full packets at update time (combine BT MTU work above?)
- replace gpbScratch accesses with Lock/UnlockScratchBuffer()

Notes
- anti-lingering code doesn't seem to do the job on the ux50. Works fine on TC
- w/ latest changes allowing user to select amongst IP transports and passing
  IP addr to SocTransport constructor is moot (uses INADDR_ANY instead)- why does OnStatusUpdate callback block during BtConnection destruction? [same r2 trashing problem?]
- "batteries are low" popup on ux50, afterwards game is suspended. ux50 is host --
  eventually TC client disconnected and then UX resumed!

FAQ
- PalmOne Tungsten T devices require a patch from PalmOne
- Sony Clie TG-50 devices require a patch from Sony
- PalmOne Tungsten TT and T2 devices can crash if the device
they're connected to disconnects uncleanly (moves out of range or
crashes). Unfortunately PalmOne has not provided a patch for this OS bug
- iPAQ h2210/2215 can spontaneously drop connections, especially if the game speed is set high
- iPAQ h4155 when hosting will only allow a single client to join. It has no problems as a client
x all iPAQs exhibit 'jumpiness' when joining high-speed games. As hosts they're fine


Level Creator FAQ
- Side 1-N must have their Intelligence set to "Human" if a human is going to be able to play that side
- Level MinPlayers must be >1
- MP games should have "[side 1, side 2, side 3, side 4] Enemy owns Exactly 0 Any Unit : End Mission: Win" trigger
- MP games should have "[side 1, side 2, side 3, side 4] Allies owns Exactly 0 Any Unit : End Mission: Lose" trigger
? win trigger must come before lose trigger

UNEXPECTED GAME TERMINATION WHEN PPC (H2210) IS CLIENT OF A 4X GAME SERVED BY A PALM (TT)
@ update 5826, 1791, 184(!!)

TT reports
BtConnection::SocketProc EventDisconnect L2DiscLincDisc
GenericMEProc::EventACLDisconnect MeStatusPowerOff ("other end terminated (about to power off)")

H2210 reports
WcConnection::OnRemoteDisconnected(reason = 0) ("Zero (0) if the cause of disconnect was a “disconnect indicator callback” from the L2CAP stack layer.")
<one of the BT stack thread exits!>
WcTransport::OnStackStatusChange(DEVST_DOWN) ("Device is present, but down")
"Connection to host has been severed"
long timeout trying to perform inquiry
! Can't game search thereafter, even after exiting/restarting WI
!! Attempting to launch Bluetooth Manager after reports
	"The Bluetooth Radio failed to turn ON due to insufficient driver memory available.
	You must perform a normal reet befor you can turn ON the Bluetooth Radio."
? How does it know this? No such error codes are exposed through the BTW-CE DK

Sequence:
- play game, end due to congestion-related failure (strange client halt, due to missed Update from server?)
- exit game normally
- restart game
- quickly hit dropped connection
- BT stack hosed, confirmed by Bluetooth Manager error
- reset
- host crashed
	Assert(pnmCopy != NULL, "Out of memory allocating pnmCopy!");
- "Your connection to the host has been severed."
- exit game
